This repository contains the full VHDL source code for a 12-bit integer arithmetic calculator.
I created this calculator for the course ENEL373.

The calculator can  perform the tasks of addition subtraction,multiplication, divison
and exponentiation.

A test bench was also created in order to test that the ALU
was giving the expected outputs for given inputs.
